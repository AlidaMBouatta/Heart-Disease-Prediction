# Heart-Disease-Prediction
A project that predicts whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not.

### Description of the workflow 
    1. Importing libraries and datasets.
    2. Data understanding and exploration.
    3. Data preprocessing and cleaning.
    4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
    5. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
    6. Model training and evaluation using two different algorithms: Logistic Regression and KNN
### The dataset
    - 'age': Age of the patient.
    - 'sex': Gender of the patient.
    - 'cp': Chest pain type.
    - 'trtbps': Resting blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - 'chol': Cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - 'exng': Exercise-induced angina.
    - 'fbs': Fasting blood sugar level.
    - 'restecg': Resting electrocardiographic results.
    - 'thalachh': Maximum heart rate achieved.
    - 'slp': Slope.
    - 'caa': Number of major vessels.
    - 'thall': Thallium stress test result.
    - 'output': Target variable (0 for less chance of heart attack, 1 for more chance of heart attack).
